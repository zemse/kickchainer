# KickChainer

This is a Web 3.0 version of a popular crowd funding Web 2.0 app called KickStarter.

## Why this project

In Kickstarter, a Web 2.0 type website, a creator can start a campaign for crowd to fund. The fundamental problem with this, is the problem of trust. There have been a lot of cases of scams on this site. Project creators post a good looking project and after getting funding, instead spending on project, they disappear with the money. Solution of this problem is a good use case of Blockchain Technology, which is a mathematically proven trust mechanism that removes the need for human intervention in the trust system altogether.
